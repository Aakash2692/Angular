Data binding in AngularJS is the synchronization between the model and the view. 

It basically means sharing the data from TypeScript file to HTML file of component.

It defines the communication between a component and the DOM.

Angular supports two-way data binding i.e. we can both send and receive data.

The two-way data binding in Angular enables data to flow from the component to the view and the other way round.
